# CROSS CULTURAL COMPARISON OF HUMAN GROWTH TRAJECTORIES

In this project, we will apply the growth model recently developed by Bunce, Fern√°ndez, and Revilla-Minaya 2022 (Causal models of human growth and their estimation using temporally-sparse data) to longitudinal datasets from populations inhabiting a wide range of ecoregions with the aim of distinguishing and describing general patterns and global variation in human growth trajectories. By using this model, we expect to be able to estimate, and hopefully disentangle, the relative contributions of different factors affecting growth in height and weight around the world, as well as to compare specific components of growth among diverse populations
