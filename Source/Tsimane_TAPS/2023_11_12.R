#2. Check if there are duplicated rows

# 3. Check how many people have X observations?
table(table(dat$person_id)) # most ind. have 6 obs. 

# 4. Add column 'estimated age' to make it easier to assess whether differences are likely or not 
### ! Check first the format of input dates, such as whether month is before day, whether numbers
# or month names are used, and n of digits for the year field, etc.

#### ----> no dates, only age
